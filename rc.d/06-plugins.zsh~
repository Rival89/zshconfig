# Autocomplete automatically selects a backend for its recent dirs completions.
# So, normally you won't need to change this.
# However, you can set it if you find that the wrong backend is being used.
zstyle ':autocomplete:recent-dirs' fasd
# cdr:  Use Zsh's `cdr` function to show recent directories as completions.
# no:   Don't show recent directories.
# zsh-z|zoxide|z.lua|z.sh|autojump|fasd: Use this instead (if installed).
# ⚠️ NOTE: This setting can NOT be changed at runtime.

zstyle ':autocomplete:*' widget-style menu-select
# complete-word: (Shift-)Tab inserts the top (bottom) completion.
# menu-complete: Press again to cycle to next (previous) completion.
# menu-select:   Same as `menu-complete`, but updates selection in menu.
# ⚠️ NOTE: This setting can NOT be changed at runtime.

# The Zsh Autocomplete plugin sends *a lot* of characters to your terminal.
# This is fine locally on modern machines, but if you're working through a slow
# ssh connection, you might want to add a slight delay before the
# autocompletion kicks in:
   zstyle ':autocomplete:*' min-delay 0.5  # seconds
#
# If your connection is VERY slow, then you might want to disable
# autocompletion completely and use only tab completion instead:
   zstyle ':autocomplete:*' async yes
